# Introduction to Create React App

This project is built using Create React App as its foundational framework.

## List of Scripts You Can Use

### npm start
- **Command**: Runs your application in development mode.
- **Instructions**: Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your app. Any changes you make will trigger a page reload. You might also notice lint errors in the console.

### npm test
- **Command**: Initiates the test runner in a responsive watch mode.
- **More Information**: Check the section on running tests.

### npm run build
- **Command**: Prepares your app for production by building it into the build folder. It optimally bundles React in production mode and enhances the build for optimal performance. The output is minimized, and the filenames are hashed. Your application is then ready for deployment!
- **Deployment Details**: Refer to the deployment guide.

### npm run eject
- **Warning**: Eject is irreversible. Once you do it, there's no going back! If the default build tools and configurations aren't to your liking, you can eject them anytime. This removes the single-build dependency and directly moves all configuration files and indirect dependencies (like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. This means you now have complete control over these files. You can still use all commands except eject. Eject isn't necessary and is recommended for most users, especially those with smaller or medium-sized projects.
