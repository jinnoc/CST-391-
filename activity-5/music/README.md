# Introduction to Create React App

This project is initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts You Can Use

Within the root directory of your project, these commands are available:

### `npm start`

This command runs your application in development mode.
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application in the browser.

The application will automatically reload if you modify any of the source files.
You might also notice lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

This command starts the test runner in a continuous interactive mode.
For additional details on running tests, visit [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This compiles the app for production to the `build` folder.
It effectively bundles React in production mode, optimizing the build for optimal performance.

The build output is minified, and filenames include hashes.
Your application is now ready for deployment!

For deployment instructions, refer to [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Important: `eject` is irreversible. Once you `eject`, there’s no going back!**

If you decide the default build tool and configuration aren’t to your liking, you can `eject` anytime. This command removes the single build dependency and copies all necessary configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control. All commands will remain functional, but they will refer to the scripts that are now part of your project. This means you can adjust them as needed. Ejection is permanent, and it’s not required for most projects, but it’s there if you need it.

## Additional Information
